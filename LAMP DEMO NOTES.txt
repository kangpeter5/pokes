LAMP DEMO NOTES

cd pem\ files/
ssh -i red_proj.pem ubuntu@52.26.202.47

sudo -s //no need to run sudo anymore
apt-get update
apt-get install lamp-server^
apt-get install git //or gitbash

cd /
ls
//start here
cd /var/www/
cd html
vi index.html
get github http and input it here
	git clone //http address//
rm index.html
cd /etc/apache2/sud
cd sites-enabled
vi 000-default.conf 

click "INSERT" button

Look for: DocumentRoot /var/www/html within the 000-default.conf file and change it to: DocumentRoot /var/www/html/[github project name] Save and Exit
Now this step is really important. If you renamed your CodeIgniter folder to something else, make sure that you tell 000-default.conf file about it. You can even remove the html folder within the www folder.
You have the option to download the CodeIgniter application within the www folder instead of html and it would still work, just make sure 000-default.conf file knows where it's at. Example: DocumentRoot /var/www/myfirstinstance

since using htaccess

sudo a2enmod rewrite
sudo service apache2 restart

cd /etc/apache2
sudo vi apache2.conf

This is a large file so let's search for the part of the file where it says something with 'root.' We can do this in vi by running this command while you are in normal mode.

/root
Then go down a few more lines until you see something like this

<Directory /var/www/>
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride None
    Require all granted
</Directory>

//Change it to this
<Directory /var/www/>
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride All
    Require all granted
</Directory>

sudo service apache2 restart
